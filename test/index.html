    <!--  This <script> tag is [temporarily] put [at the <head> tag] due to [testing [JavaScript concepts]].
      
    <script src="script.js" defer></script>

    1. The [defer] attribute is a [boolean attribute].

    2. If the [defer] is set, it [specifies] that the [script] is [downloaded] in [parallel to parsing the page], and [executed] [after the page has finished parsing].  

    3. Using [defer] attribute is [PREFERRED] and [RECOMMENDED].

    NOTE 1:
    1. The [defer] attribute is only used for [external script] (should only be used if the [src] attribute is present).

    NOTE 2:
    There are several ways an external script can be executed:

    1. If [async] is [present]: The [script is downloaded in parallel to parsing the page], and [executed as soon as it is available.] (before parsing completes)

    2. If [defer] is [present] (and not async): The [script] is [downloaded in parallel to parsing the page], and [executed] [after the page has finished parsing].

    3. If [neither [async] or [defer]] is [present]: The [script is downloaded and executed] immediately, [blocking parsing] [until the script is completed].

    //  The [src] attributes specifies the URL of an external script file.   //
    
    1. This <script> tag is showing up the right on the top of this existing HTML because we put the <script> tag inside of the <head> of the document.
  
    2. You can control where the JavaScript generated HTML shows up by controlling where you put this <script> tag.
